This Portfolio project was infact very hard for me. I really struggled with the interactive<br /> components. At first I wanted to incorporate a map. I fought endlessly with mapbox and<br /> eventually decided to call it quits. I could not figure out how to properly layer the map then add<br /> the style. After creating it in data base I went into tilesets but the moment I added a <br />new layer it erased my data. It was incredibly frustrating. I found the timelines to be easy <br />and straightforward. I really enjoyed writing them. The only thing I did not like however<br /> was that I had to upload my photos onto a website. They are personal family photos and I <br />cringe at the thought of them being public. When this project has been marked and given back <br />to me I plan on taking them down from social media. Voyant was straightforward. At first <br />I was unable to figure out how to embed it properly. I first googled “embed voyant” and<br /> tried a series of codes before realizing there was an export button on the voyant website with <br />the URL I wanted to use. The pie chart was also very difficult at first. I first calculated by <br />hand the percentages I wanted to use, then implemented them onto the zingchart website <br />through the “edit” option. I could not figure out how to share this with github so at first I <br />saved the edit I had done on my desktop. It did not however allow me to engage with the <br />project, it more or less saved as a jpeg or pdf. I then downloaded the pie chart and tried to<br /> drag it into the github webpage. This was very time consuming and ineffective. Next I <br />tried to make a call on the index.html such as “zingchart.html/pie chart”. Again, this was <br />ineffective. Eventually I learned that to export the URL you had to change information you<br /> wanted on the edit option on zingchart.com then save it in order to export the URL. I <br />chose to add videos to make the website a little more interactive and was able to find the <br />codes online without too much distress. The spacing of the images was another issue. It <br />took a while to find the right code to align the images horizontally rather than vertically<br /> and then to discover the correct spacing between the images so they were all even. I tested <br />the distance and spaced them evenly. The last issue I had which I am still unable to resolve<br /><br /> was on how to change the text within the buttons. I went through css, css.min, javascript and HTML. I looked up codes, changed all the colors, implemented more codes<br /> and still have been unsuccessful. This was probably the aspect of the project I spent <br />the most time on. I was able to have the text highlighted when the toggle bar drops down<br /> but I have no clue how I did that and do not know how to change it back. I tried<br /> adjusting my image so that the white would not show but the image did not look as good. For <br />every photo included in the site I first reshaped then cropped the size on Irfanview. <br />Learning these programs have improved my understanding of coding, and I believe the <br />interactive tools I used accentuated the information provided. It was important for me to show <br />what Jewish culture is/was like prior to the war (voyant), show how many Jewish people <br />were devastated because of it (pie chart), the events in my grandparents life (timeline) and <br />why they were significant to the public and my own private life (videos).

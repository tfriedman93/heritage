          <p font style="calibri";>My grandfather (zeida) Israel Friedman was born in Kamien, Poland. His mother Mechla and father David were well respected within the community. The town my zeida was born in no longer exists; due to the war parts of it have been absorbed into neighboring communities and the remaining area has been re-named. My zeida was 1 of 7 children, with 4 girls and 3 boys. My great grandfather David was the mayor of the community; during his prime he was well respected. When the war broke out, my zeida went into hiding in a nearby town with his brother Joe. He was in hiding throughout the duration of the war, evading Nazi soldiers almost daily. When the war ended my zeida and Joe went to Cracow to locate their family members. Unsuccessful, they separated-- my zeida began to work in the black market as a smuggler and his brother continued to look for the family. After years of hardship my zeida was sponsored by extended family to immigrate to Canada. </p>
<p>My zeida met my baba in 1950 and they married a year later. In the beginning, life in Winnipeg, Manitoba was hard. He spoke little English and struggled to find work. In the beginning he would sell cattle to farmers; life on the farm taught him a great deal about cattle and crop yields. Eventually he opened an automotive garage which still exists today. Boyd Autobody is my zeida's greatest legacy. </p>

  <p font style="calibri";>This is the house my zeida was born in, and the video is narrated by my dad Brian Friedman. My zeida's family moved in 1932 prior to the war. Before the family moved, my great grandfather ran a tobacco shop on the side of his house. The house is completely intact. It was very important for the current owners to let us know they bought the house legally. Before and during the war many people forced Jews out of their property and accumulated property illegally. Today, many relatives are seeking said land and claiming ownership. It is a large issue for the Polish people.</p>

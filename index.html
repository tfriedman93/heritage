 <h1 style="color:#bdad75;"><h1 style="font-family:Lucida Handwriting;">About this project</h1>
<p style="color:black;">The theme “Bones of our Past” has inspired me to write about my trip to Poland this summer. My dad, sister and I went to Poland to explore our heritage. Due to Jewish persecution prior, during and after the second World War, many familial documents were destroyed in an attempt to hide Jewish heritage. I am Jewish. All four of my grandparents endured the Holocaust and are originally from Poland. This portfolio project will chronicle my father’s parents lives prior, during and after the Holocaust in Poland. It will mention important dates and locations. My grandparents were lucky in that they survived, many of their family members did not and perished in concentration camps or locations unknown. For this reason it was very important for me to document and explore my history.  After the second World War my grandparents miraculously immigrated to Canada and have been there ever since. However, the second and third generation are ultimately unacquainted with our family history. This project has helped me to trace some of my lineage, and for that I am thankful.</p> 
   <h1> History of Poland</h1>

</html>
   
  <p style="color:black";>In 1933 1.7% of the total European population was Jewish (9.5 million). This represented more
 than 60 percent of the world’s population at that time. Poland was home to the second-largest
 Jewish population, comprised of over three million Jews. Warsaw was comprised of 300,000
 Jews (30% of the population of the city). Within the duration of the Second World War, 85% of 
Polish Jewry was exterminated. Many Jews were deported across Europe to German occupied
 Poland where they   were imprisoned in concentration camps and or murdered. Since the Second
 World War Poland has not rebuilt the same Jewish community as it once had. Jewish people 
have occupied Poland for over a thousand years. The initial mass migration was due to 
detrimental controversies in western and central Europe. Over time, Jewish people gained rights
 (mainly argued for by the Polish King Kazimierz the Great in the 14th century) who encouraged 
Jewish settlements in Poland. Jews were a crucial part of Poland’s identity for centuries; the first
coins issued in Poland bore Hebrew, not Polish inscriptions. Click

	    <p font style="calibri;text-align:center">"The Jewish communities of eastern Europe were devastated. In 1933, Poland had the largest Jewish population in Europe, numbering over three million. By 1950, the Jewish population of Poland was reduced to about 45,000. The Soviet Union had the largest remaining Jewish population, with some two million Jews. Romania's Jewish population was nearly 757,000 in 1930 and fell to approximately 280,000 (1950). Most of these demographic losses were due to the Holocaust, the rest to postwar emigration from Europe."<em>USHMM</em></p>

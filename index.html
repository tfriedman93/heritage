<p style="text-align:center;"><p style="color:white;">The theme "Bones of our past" has inspired me to write about my trip to Poland this summer with my dad and sister. Poland in the 1930's and 40's was a dangerous places for Jews. My family had to flee in order to survive. This summer my dad, sister, and I visited the town my grandmother grew up in as well as the family who harboured my grandfather during the war. My grandparents were lucky in that they survived. Many of their family members did not however. Some died in concentration camps (such as the infamous Auschwitz-Birkenau) and others location of death is uknown. Many Jews tried to flee before and during the war, burning documents or pieces of evidence which linked them to their Judaism. Because of this, my family is unable to trace most of our family lineage. This project is important because it represents the small amount of information we do have of our family records.</p> 
   <h1> History of Poland</h1>
   <!-- insert history of poland -->
   <p style="text-align:center;"><p style="color:white;">In 1933 1.7% of the total European population was Jewish (9.5 million). This represented more than 60 percent of the world’s population at that time. Poland was home to the second-largest Jewish population, comprised of over three million Jews. Warsaw was comprised of 300,000 Jews (30% of the population of the city). Within the duration of the Second World War, 85% of Polish Jewry was exterminated. Many Jews were deported across Europe to German occupied Poland where they were imprisoned in concentration camps and or murdered. Since the Second World War Poland has not rebuilt the same Jewish community as it once had. Jewish people have occupied Poland for over a thousand years. The initial mass migration was due to detrimental controversies in western and central Europe. Over time, Jewish people gained rights (mainly argued for by the Polish King Kazimierz the Great in the 14th century) who encouraged Jewish settlements in Poland. Jews were a crucial part of Poland’s identity for centuries; the first coins issued in Poland bore Hebrew, not Polish inscriptions.</p>
